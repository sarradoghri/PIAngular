Git Documentation for Comaperit ‚Äì Smart Price Comparison Platform
üßæ Document Title:
Version Control Guidelines for Comaperit: Git Workflow and Best Practices

üìÑ Detailed Description
About the Project ‚Äì Comaperit
Comaperit is an innovative smart price comparison platform developed using Angular for the frontend. It empowers users to compare prices across products, hotels, and flights in real time. The system uses artificial intelligence, machine learning, and business intelligence to provide smart recommendations, price predictions, and insightful dashboards for both consumers and businesses. To ensure scalable, maintainable, and collaborative development, a robust version control system using Git is critical.

This Git documentation outlines the foundational setup and operational practices for using Git effectively in the Comaperit Angular project. It serves as a reference guide for all developers contributing to the project, ensuring consistency, reliability, and quality across all stages of development.

To define the branching strategy for feature development, bug fixing, and releases.

To enforce consistent commit messages and changelogs for easier tracking.

To reduce merge conflicts and improve collaboration in a multi-developer environment.

To support continuous integration and agile deployment practices.
